Readme file for the Encyclopedia Galactica Milestone1 project at Code Institute (html/css only).

The title is a bit easy to misinterpret I suppose since the aim is nowhere near creating an online encyclopedia.

The aim is to pay tribute to my favorite author, Isac Azimov, and the title reflects on that since his Foundation stories have an encyclopedia galactica in the background.
Apart from a short about-page about the author himself, the focus will be on creating an accessible timeline of his rather long series of books placed in the same fictional
future, using as a wide area of html and css functionality I can cram into it while still adhering to the K.I.S.S acronym.

That is to say, this project borrows from project idea one. The difference is of course that the historical event(s) here are fictional and set far into the future.
