                    <tD><br><br>Perhaps the most well-respected and largest series in science fiction, Isaac Asimov's
                        Robot-Empire-Foundation Series encompasses dozens of books and tens of thousands of years of
                        future history.
                        <br><br>Due to the enormous timescales (for human standards), there are many characters to keep
                        track of. Most of them are only part of the narrative for a limited amount of time so the site
                        will not go into details of them.
                        <br><br>The most important ones are

                            Bailey</a>,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw" target="_blank"
                            aria-label="Link to wikipedia article about Daneel Olivaw (opens in new tab)">R. Daneel
                            Olivaw</a>,
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Robot_series_characters#R._Giskard_Reventlov"
                            target="_blank"
                            aria-label="Link to wikipedia article about Giskard Reventlov (opens in new tab)">R. Giskard
                            Reventlov</a> (R stands for Robot), and
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" target="_blank"
                            aria-label="Link to wikipedia article about Hari Seldon (opens in new tab)">Hari Seldon</a>
                        <br><br>Maybe one can consider "Three laws of Robotics" as a character on its own since it is so
                        vital to the entire series. Most likely what Asimov is most famous for.
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="robotics">1: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human
                            being to come to harm;</p>
                        <p class="robotics">2: A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such
                            orders would conflict with the First Law;</p>
                        <p class="robotics">3: A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does
                            not conflict with the First or Second Law;</p>
                        <p class="robotics">The Zeroth Law: A robot may not harm humanity, or, by inaction, allow
                            humanity to come to harm.</p>
                        <br><br>This site is essentially a homeage to both the series itself and to Dr Asimov. Most
                        certainly the author I have read the most of and that I have the utmost of respect for.
                        <br><br>The choice was between him and J.R.R. Tolkien, even though they couldn't be more
                        different in what they chose to write about on superficial level.
                        <br><br>If you dig further in, they are similar in many ways. Partially by how complex their
                        respective fictional universe is, but more importantly: their faith that humanity can and will
                        prevail even when disasters try to tell us otherwise.
                        <br><br>In the end, I chose Asimov over Tolkien here since I favor the scientific (or
                        psuedo-scientific in some cases) of science fiction over the magical/divine aspects. But I
                        digress.
                        <br><br>I hope the site do the chosen subject justice!
