        <div class="main">
            <p>Perhaps the most well-respected and largest series in science fiction, Isaac Asimov's Robot-Empire-Foundation Series encompasses dozens of books and tens of thousands of years of future history.</p>
            <p><br>This site is essentially a homeage to both the series itself and to Dr Asimov. Most certainly the author I have read the most of and that I have the utmost of respect for.
            <p><br>The choice was between him and J.R.R. Tolkien, even though they couldn't be more different in what they chose to write about on superficial level.</p>
            <p><br>If you dig further in, they are similar in many ways. Partially by how complex their respective fictional universe is, but more importantly: their faith that humanity can and will prevail even when disasters try to tell us otherwise.</p>
            <p><br>In the end, I chose Asimov over Tolkien here since I favor the scientific (or psuedo-scientific in some cases) of science fiction over the magical/divine aspects. But I digress.</p>
            <p><br>I hope the site do the chosen subject justice!</p>
