            <p>Perhaps the most well-respected and largest series in science fiction, Isaac
                Asimov's Robot-Empire-Foundation Series encompasses dozens of books and tens
                of thousands of years of future history.
                
                <p>Isaac Asimov's Robot-Empire-Foundation series (so called because it's the
                union of what was originally three separate storylines into a single
                fictional universe) is the story of the rise of man from the present day
                onward.  It begins with the creation of sentient robots which brings about
                an unpleasant backlash on Earth, despite the use of Asimov's famous "three
                laws of robotics" which ensure that robots remain mankinds servants.
                Eventually man spreads, colonizing the bulk of the galaxy and forming a
                single empire that encompasses many thousand planets.  The rigid and
                bureaucratic empire undergoes a decline reminiscent of the decline and fall
                of the Roman empire.  Fortunately a visionary steps forward with a
                clandestine plan to bring a more robust civilization (known as the
                Foundation) from the ashes of the original empire.
