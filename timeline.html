                        that the timeline is rather condensed. A lot more could be added). Some of the years have been
                        converted between C.E (current era), G.E (Galactic Era), and F.E (Foundation Era) to give a better understanding
                        of the time-scale. Unfortunately, it can only be an approximation infered from the various texts
                        since a complete timeline with definite years has never been published. Everything between [...] references a book-title.
